# Learning Journey: Balance Scale Addition Game

This document will track my learning process, technical challenges, and thought process as I build the Balance Scale Addition Game. I'll update it throughout the development journey.

## Project Setup and Initial Thoughts

### Day 1: Project Planning

Today I spent time deeply understanding the requirements and planning the architecture for this educational game. I've decided to set a challenging but achievable timeline of 10 days, dedicating 4-5 hours daily to this project.

Some key insights and learnings:

1. **Educational Design Principles**: Building effective educational software requires a balance between engagement and pedagogical value. The balance scale metaphor is powerful because it leverages physical intuition to teach abstract math concepts.

2. **Technical Stack Considerations**: 
   - **Vue.js**: I'll be using Vue 3 with Composition API (open source), which offers better TypeScript integration and more flexible component logic organization than the Options API.
   - **FastAPI**: Provides strong typing via Pydantic (open source), which will help ensure data consistency between frontend and backend.
   - **Firebase**: Authentication flow needs to be carefully designed to maintain security while providing a smooth user experience (required tech stack).

3. **Visual Design Challenge**: Creating an intuitive, visually engaging balance scale that provides clear feedback will be a key challenge. I'm considering several approaches to the animation:
   - CSS transitions for simple tilting (open source browser API)
   - Canvas-based animation for more complex physics (open source browser API)
   - SVG manipulation with anime.js (open source) or Web Animations API for a balance of performance and visual quality

4. **User Experience Questions**: 
   - How to make the feedback appropriate for different age groups?
   - What's the right balance between handholding and challenge?
   - How to ensure the interface is intuitive enough that children can use it without extensive instructions?

5. **Accelerated Timeline Considerations**:
   - I'll need to focus on the core game mechanics first before adding polish
   - Firebase will be leveraged for both authentication and data storage to simplify backend integration (required tech stack)
   - Each day's progress needs to build toward a working product by day 10
   - I'll prioritize functionality over perfect visuals initially

## Design Decisions

### Visual Feedback System

I'm planning to implement a multi-layered feedback system:

1. **Immediate Physical Feedback**: The scale tilts to show if the sum is too high or too low
2. **Visual Cues**: Color changes and subtle animations to reinforce correct/incorrect answers
3. **Progression Indicators**: Clear tracking of progress to motivate continued engagement

### Technical Architecture

I'm choosing to separate the game logic from the presentation layer, which will allow:
- Easier testing of core game mechanics using Vitest (open source)
- Potential reuse of game logic in different visual presentations
- Clearer separation of concerns

## Challenges Anticipated

1. **Animation Performance**: Ensuring smooth animations across devices, especially on lower-end mobile devices - will use requestAnimationFrame and CSS transforms (open source browser APIs)
2. **State Management Complexity**: Managing game state, user progress, and configuration will require careful design - will leverage Pinia (open source)
3. **Responsive Design**: Creating an experience that works well on everything from small phone screens to large desktop displays - will use Tailwind CSS (open source)
4. **Balancing Configurability**: Making the activity builder powerful enough for educators while keeping it simple to use
5. **Time Management**: Completing all required functionality within the 10-day timeline while maintaining code quality

I'll update this document daily as I make progress, encounter and solve challenges, and learn new things throughout the development process.
