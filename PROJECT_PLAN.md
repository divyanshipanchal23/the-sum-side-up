# Balance Scale Addition Game - Project Plan

## 1. Understanding the Problem

### Core Educational Concept
The Balance Scale Addition Game uses visual intuition to teach addition fundamentals. By representing mathematical equations as physical balance, it transforms abstract number concepts into concrete visual feedback. This approach leverages:

- **Visual-spatial reasoning**: Connects mathematical concepts to physical intuition
- **Immediate feedback**: Shows consequences of mathematical decisions in real-time
- **Exploration-based learning**: Encourages experimentation and discovery

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Elementary school students (grades K-5) learning basic addition
- **Secondary**: Educators configuring activities for different skill levels
- **Tertiary**: Parents supporting at-home learning

### Key Educational Goals
1. Help students visualize the relationship between numbers
2. Provide intuitive feedback about equality and inequality
3. Build number sense through experimentation
4. Support differentiated learning through configurable difficulty

## 4. Addressing Potential Ambiguities

### Balance Scale Mechanics
- **How sensitive should the scale be?** I'll implement variable tilt sensitivity based on how far off the answer is, with configurable thresholds for different age groups.
- **Should numbers be restricted to integers?** Initially yes, with extension to decimals/fractions for advanced levels.
- **How many addends should be supported?** Start with 2 addends, expandable up to 5 for advanced users.

### User Progression
- **How should difficulty increase?** Gradually increase target number range, then introduce additional addends.
- **What metrics determine advancement?** Track success rate, time taken, and number of attempts.
- **Should incorrect answers be penalized?** No penalties, but provide constructive visual feedback.

### Educational Feedback
- **What feedback helps learning best?** Beyond visual tilting, include optional hint systems that highlight number relationships.
- **How explicit should correct/incorrect indicators be?** Age-appropriate feedback - celebrations for younger users, more subtle for older students.

### Activity Builder Complexity
- **How much customization is appropriate?** Balance ease-of-use with flexibility. Focus on key parameters (target range, addends, time limits) with sensible defaults.
- **Should templates be sharable?** Include export/import functionality for educators to share configurations.

## 5. Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Real-time Physics Animation
- **Challenge**: Creating realistic, performant balance scale animations
- **Solution**: Use Web Animations API or anime.js for smooth animations with configurable easing functions (both open source)

### Cross-device Compatibility
- **Challenge**: Ensuring consistent experience across devices
- **Solution**: Mobile-first responsive design with touch-friendly interfaces

### Data Synchronization
- **Challenge**: Maintaining state between frontend and backend
- **Solution**: Implement optimistic UI updates with backend validation

### Performance with Complex Animations
- **Challenge**: Maintaining smooth performance with animations
- **Solution**: Use requestAnimationFrame and CSS transforms for hardware acceleration (open source browser APIs)

## 6. Critical Path & Priorities

To ensure completion within 10 days, I'll focus on these priorities:

1. **Core Game Experience First**: Ensure the balance scale and game mechanics work perfectly before adding additional features
2. **MVP Before Polish**: Implement core functionality before spending time on visual refinements
3. **Modular Approach**: Build components that can be enhanced incrementally
4. **Test Early**: Test core functionalities as they're built rather than waiting until the end
5. **Simplify Where Possible**: Use Firebase for both authentication and data storage to reduce backend complexity (as required by the tech stack)

## 7. Learning Focus Areas

Throughout this project, I'll be especially focused on:

1. **Vue.js Composition API** - Leveraging the latest Vue patterns (open source)
2. **FastAPI** - Building efficient, type-safe API endpoints (open source)
3. **Educational UX Design** - Creating interfaces that support learning
4. **Animation Performance** - Implementing smooth, physics-based animations using open source tools
5. **Adaptive Difficulty Systems** - Building systems that adjust to user skill

By the end of this project, I aim to deliver not just a functional game, but an engaging educational tool that provides meaningful learning experiences through visual intuition and exploration.
